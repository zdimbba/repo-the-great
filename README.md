# Repo The Great

## Alaotsikko
At each newly arrived star system there are a number of things to do. I first discovered Lordaeron as a fledgling warrior, prone to wearing mail and even leather because I knew almost nothing about my class, while questing. ﻿I don’t care if Frost is the PvP spec du jour. Oh and soon after that, I managed to get Zen Master Archaeologist. What I enjoyed the most and felt most confirmed in, is the overall feel of the game: the atmosphere, the large scale world, the music and art, and of course the classes and races which I find, for the most part very accomplished and fun to play.
